# incremental-data-pipeline

This project demonstrates the evolution of a naïve ETL pipeline into a
production-grade, incremental data pipeline.

Key goals:
- Ingest data from multiple heterogeneous sources
- Support idempotent processing and safe re-runs
- Handle late-arriving data and backfills
- Produce analytics-ready data using a medallion architecture

Status: Initial scaffolding.
